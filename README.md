# Magic 8 Ball

A React Native Magic 8 Ball application, replicating the Magic 8 Ball toy in the form of a mobile app.

The project is a simple, single-screen application, and uses the device's accelerometer to detect when the device has been shaken to generate a response, similar to how a physical Magic 8 Ball does. Simply shake the device with the app open to generate a random Magic 8 Ball response.

# Tech Stack

### Frameworks, Tools & Languages

- React Native
- Expo
- JavaScript/TypeScript

### Dependencies

- `expo-sensors` To access the device's accelerometer
- `expo-haptics` Vibration feedback when the Magic 8 Ball starts generating

# Run Locally

### Pre-requisites

- Node.js
- Expo CLI
- Android/iOS Emulator (A Physical Device works as well)

Considering the dependencies being used in this Expo project, you should be able to run the app using Expo Go.

# Contributions

I have developed this app as a learning project to learn about the concepts of React Native, Expo and JavaScript/TypeScript. I am open to open-source contributions towards this app, if any, which can help in optimising the code or improving/adding the features inside the app.
