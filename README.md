# Magic 8 Ball

A React Native Magic-8-Ball Application, built using Expo & the expo-sensors library.

The project is a simple, single-screen application, and uses the device's accelerometer to detect when the device has been shaken to generate a response, similar to how a physical Magic 8 Ball does.

# Tech Stack

### Frameworks, Tools & Languages

- React Native
- Expo
- JavaScript/TypeScript

### Dependencies

- `expo-sensors` To access the device's accelerometer

# Run Locally

### Pre-requisites

- Node.js
- Expo CLI
- Android/iOS Emulator (A Physical Device works as well)

Considering the dependencies being used in this Expo project, you should be able to run the app using Expo Go.

# Contributions

I have developed this app as a learning project to learn about the concepts of React Native, Expo and JavaScript/TypeScript. I am open to open-source contributions towards this app, if any, which can help in optimising the code or improving/adding the features inside the app.
